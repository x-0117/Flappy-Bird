This one is a very simplified implementation of the classic game "Flappy Bird" using
python.
> It is a completely CLI based game.
> No extra libraries needed.

GAMEPLAY :
> Press enter to fly higher.
> On doing nothing, the bird descends automatically.
> Avoid hitting the obstacles.

SCORE :
> Directly proportional to the distance covered.
